The patient was in his usual state of health prior to the stress test. He retired from his job of years just 3 days ago. While on the treadmill the patient developed left shoulder pain (similar to previous anginal pains) and ST changes on EKG. Echocardiography revealed 4+ aortic regurgitation (patient was noted to be 1+ on last echo in . After getting off the treadmill the pain went away and he felt back to baseline. The patient has otherwise been asymptomatic. He exercises 3 times per week and will notice faint chest pain only with maximal exercise. He denies shortness of breath, PND, lower extremity edema and orthopnea. He has not noticed any fevers, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. After the stress test the patient was sent straight to the ED. In the ED he had an EKG which reportedly showed no ischemic changes. He had a CTA chest which was negative for aortic dissection. He was then admitted to the cardiology service for further management. Currently the patient is asymptomatic although he is considerably distressed by this new diagnosis. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.","On Admission: VS- 97.8 157/64 101 18 98% RA GENERAL- WDWN in NAD.
